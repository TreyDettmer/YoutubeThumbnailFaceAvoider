### Motivation

As someone who frequently browses YouTube, I am often annoyed by the clickbait thumbnails that plague so much of the popular content. This is what motivated me to make an application that would remove these thumbnails so I wouldn't have to look at them. Although this application would likely not be practical, I saw this as an oppurtunity to broaden my CS knowledge and skillset.
